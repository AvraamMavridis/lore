# Lore Git configuration for intelligent merging
# These attributes enable the custom Lore merge driver for handling reasoning conflicts

# Merge strategy for Lore index files (append-only strategy)
# When conflicts occur, both branches' reasoning entries are preserved
.lore/index.json merge=lore

# Optional: Also handle entry files with append-only strategy
# This ensures individual reasoning entries are never lost during merges
.lore/entries/*.json merge=lore
