  "intent": "Updated docs to use coffee-bean color theme in Tailwind",
  "reasoning_trace": "The user requested updating the docs to use a specific coffee-bean color palette with CSS custom properties ranging from 50 (lightest: #fce9ef) to 950 (darkest: #1f040e).\n\nChanges made:\n1. Updated Tailwind CDN inline config to include the full coffee-bean color palette (50-950)\n2. Set primary color to #e01f62 (coffee-bean-500) and secondary to #b4184f (coffee-bean-600)\n3. Updated the hero gradient from purple/violet (#667eea → #764ba2) to coffee-bean tones (#e01f62 → #5a0c27)\n4. Replaced all gray-* utility classes with corresponding coffee-bean-* classes:\n   - bg-gray-900 → bg-coffee-bean-950 (darkest backgrounds)\n   - bg-gray-800 → bg-coffee-bean-900 (section backgrounds)\n   - border-gray-800/700 → border-coffee-bean-800/700\n   - text-gray-100/200/300/400/500/600 → text-coffee-bean-50/100/200/300/400\n\nThe coffee-bean palette is actually a warm magenta/rose color scheme despite its name, creating a distinctive pink-toned dark theme.\n\nTrade-offs:\n- Pro: Consistent theming across the entire page using a single color palette\n- Pro: The dark tones (900-950) provide good contrast for readability\n- Con: Lost the green accent color (text-green-400) for positive table values, now uses same coffee-bean-300 as other text\n\nWarning: The code-block class still uses a hardcoded dark background (#1e1e2e) which doesn't match the coffee-bean palette. This was intentional to maintain good code readability with syntax highlighting, but could be updated to use coffee-bean-950 for more consistency.",
