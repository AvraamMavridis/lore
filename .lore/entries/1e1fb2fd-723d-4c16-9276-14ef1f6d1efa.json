  "reasoning_trace": "Made multiple improvements to the project:\n\n1. Fixed 4 clippy warnings:\n   - Added #[allow(dead_code)] to public API methods (workdir, is_ignored, hash_string) that are tested but not used in the binary\n   - Added #[allow(dead_code)] to staged field in ChangedFile struct\n   - Simplified map_or to is_some_and for cleaner code\n\n2. Documentation improvements:\n   - Created release tag v0.1.1 to trigger GitHub Actions release workflow\n   - Updated README.md installation instructions with sudo commands and PowerShell options\n   - Reorganized README structure: moved Installation section before AI agent integration sections\n   - Renamed 'Manual Usage' to 'Recording with Lore' for clarity\n\n3. Fixed UI layout glitch in docs/index.html:\n   - Changed installation section from 3-column grid to full-width stacked layout\n   - Reordered platforms: Linux → macOS → Windows\n   - Added inline SVG logos for each platform\n   - Improved code formatting with single-line commands\n   - Better spacing and alignment\n\nAll tests pass and clippy is clean.",
