  "intent": "Added release workflow and pre-built binary installation instructions",
  "reasoning_trace": "Created a complete release pipeline so users can install lore without needing Rust/Cargo.\n\nRelease Workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml):\n- Triggers on version tags (v*)\n- Builds for 5 targets:\n  - Linux x86_64 and ARM64\n  - macOS x86_64 (Intel) and ARM64 (Apple Silicon)\n  - Windows x86_64\n- Uses matrix strategy for parallel builds\n- Cross-compiles Linux ARM64 using gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu\n- Creates GitHub Release with all binaries attached\n- Uses softprops/action-gh-release for release creation\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n- README.md: Added platform-specific sections with curl commands\n- docs/index.html: Created a 3-column grid layout for macOS/Linux/Windows\n- Direct download links using GitHub's /releases/latest/download/ URL pattern\n- Windows gets a download button since curl isn't as common there\n- Kept 'build from source' as a fallback option for developers\n\nKey decisions:\n1. Used /usr/local/bin as install location (standard, usually in PATH)\n2. Named binaries with platform suffix for clarity in releases\n3. Used 'latest' URL so docs don't need updating for each release\n4. Included both x86_64 and ARM64 for Linux/macOS to cover all modern hardware",
