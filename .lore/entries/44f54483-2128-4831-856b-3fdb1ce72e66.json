  "reasoning_trace": "Added visual branding for Claude Code and Cursor integration sections to make them more recognizable and professional.\n\nChanges:\n1. README.md - Added img tags with height=40 for both logos:\n   - Claude logo (claude_logo.svg.png) above Claude Code Integration heading\n   - Cursor logo (cursor_logo.png) above Cursor Integration heading\n\n2. docs/index.html - Added centered logo images with Tailwind classes:\n   - Claude logo with h-12 class in a flex container above the section title\n   - Cursor logo with same styling above Cursor Integration section\n   - Logos are copied to docs/ folder for proper relative paths\n\nThe logos help users quickly identify which AI tool each section applies to, improving scannability of the documentation.",
