  "intent": "Added multi-platform build matrix for Linux, macOS, and Windows",
  "reasoning_trace": "Added a separate build job that runs on multiple platforms to ensure cross-platform compatibility.\n\nStructure:\n- The existing 'test' job remains on Ubuntu and handles linting, formatting, and tests\n- The new 'build' job uses a matrix strategy to build and test on:\n  - ubuntu-latest (Linux)\n  - macos-latest (macOS)\n  - windows-latest (Windows)\n\nKey decisions:\n1. Used fail-fast: false so all platforms complete even if one fails - this gives full visibility into platform-specific issues\n2. Used --release flag for builds to catch release-only issues and verify optimized builds work\n3. Kept lint/fmt checks in the Ubuntu-only job since they're platform-independent\n4. Each platform job runs tests too, since test behavior can differ across OSes (filesystem, paths, etc.)\n\nTrade-offs:\n- Pro: Catches platform-specific build issues before merge\n- Pro: Tests run on all platforms, catching OS-specific bugs\n- Con: Increases total CI time (though jobs run in parallel)\n- Con: Uses more GitHub Actions minutes\n\nThe matrix runs all three platforms in parallel, so wall-clock time increase is minimal despite running 3x the builds.",
