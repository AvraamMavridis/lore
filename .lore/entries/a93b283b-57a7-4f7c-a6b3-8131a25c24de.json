  "intent": "Added author attribution for Avraam Mavridis with website and LinkedIn links",
  "reasoning_trace": "Added clear author attribution to both the project website (index.html) and README.md per user request.\n\nChanges made:\n1. index.html - Added author info to the footer section with:\n   - Name linked to personal website (https://www.avraam.dev/)\n   - Separate LinkedIn link (https://www.linkedin.com/in/avrmav/)\n   - Used the primary color for the name link to make it stand out\n   - Kept consistent styling with existing footer elements\n\n2. README.md - Added an 'Author' section just before the License section with:\n   - Name linked to personal website\n   - LinkedIn link using markdown bullet separator\n\nPlacement decisions:\n- Footer is the standard place for author attribution on websites\n- Author section before License follows common README conventions",
