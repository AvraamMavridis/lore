  "intent": "Added cargo fmt and clippy checks to CI pipeline",
  "reasoning_trace": "Added formatting and linting checks to catch code quality issues early in the CI pipeline.\n\nThe changes add two new steps before the build:\n1. cargo fmt --all -- --check - Verifies code formatting matches rustfmt standards\n2. cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings - Runs the Rust linter with all targets/features and treats warnings as errors\n\nThese run BEFORE build/test to fail fast on style issues without wasting CI time on builds that will need reformatting anyway.\n\nTrade-offs:\n- Pro: Catches formatting and lint issues before merge, enforces consistent code style\n- Pro: -D warnings ensures no lints slip through\n- Con: Slightly longer CI time (though clippy is fast)\n\nThe --all-targets flag ensures clippy checks tests and examples too, not just library code.\nThe --all-features flag ensures feature-gated code is also checked.",
